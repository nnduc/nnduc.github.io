Also make sure that you have at least 10GB of free space on your Mac. You can check how much space you have by clicking on the Apple logo icon in the menu bar, then click on About this Mac, then click on the Storage tab. You should see something similar to the screenshot below.<br><img src="/assets/images/mac-storage-space.png" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to a WiFi network and then launch the Mac App Store.</li>
<li>Let the Mac App Store refresh properly and then click on the Updates tab at the top.</li>
<li><p>In a few seconds the new High Sierra update will show up. When it does, you’ll see an Update button right next to it. Click on it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At this point, the download will commence. But once it’s complete, just follow the on-screen prompts for installation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Mac will become completely unusable during the installation time period so make sure you save all your work ahead of proceedings. But as soon as the installation is complete, you’ll be prompted to enter your Apple ID password then you can start using your Mac immediately.</p>
<p>The over the air route is great and all, but occasionally users might run into performance related issues down the line. Therefore it’s recommended you go for the clean install method, provided you have the time and patience. But if everything is working out just fine for you then you’re golden.</p>

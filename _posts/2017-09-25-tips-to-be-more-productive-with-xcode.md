## Tips to be more productive with Xcode

### 1. Decide Where to Open a File
In Xcode, you can open a file in various ways: in the standard editor, in a new or existing assistant editor, in a new or existing tab, or in a new window. Here's how you can decide about this:

When clicking on a file in the Navigator, hold down `Shift` + `Option`
When clicking on a symbol in an editor pane, hold down `Shift` + `Option` + `Command`
A pop-over will appear and let you choose where exactly you want this file to be displayed:
